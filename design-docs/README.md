# Spyder design documentation

:construction: Spyder design documentation is a work in progress.

Spyder design documentation collects information on the styling and best practices for elements of Spyder's interface.
These documents are a reference point for anyone contributing to Spyder.
By documenting the design decisions that have been made across many meetings, issues, pull requests, and other discussions, Spyder can continue to provide a better user experience with the help of thw whole community.

These documents are organized based on [Atomic Design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), which uses atomic naming conventions to describe the relationship and hierarchy of designs.
